### **Program Features**

1. **Create Fruit Entry**
   - Add a new fruit to the inventory, including details such as name, quantity, and price.

   - Fetch and display a list of all fruits in the database in a user-friendly format.

3. **Update Fruit Details**
   - Modify the quantity or price of an existing fruit in the inventory.

Fruitify ensures robust error handling by gracefully managing issues such as:
- Invalid inputs
- Authentication failures
- Server-related errors

### **Example Use Case**
A fruit vendor can utilize Fruitify to manage their inventory effectively:
- Add fruits like **Apple** or **Banana** with starting stock and price details.
- View their entire stock and update fruit prices based on market trends.
- Remove fruits that are out of season or no longer sold.

### **Technical Requirements**
- Use **Python** with the `requests` module, or **PHP** with `cURL` or `Guzzle`, to interact with the API.
- Secure API credentials using **environment variables**.
- Provide a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a basic **web interface** (optional for PHP with HTML forms).

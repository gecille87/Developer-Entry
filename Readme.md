# Fruitify: The Ultimate Inventory Builder using Fruitask API üçáüçåüçé

Your challenge is to build a simple inventory management application for fruits using the [**Fruitask API**](https://avocado-5.gitbook.io/fruitask-api/quick-start). The application will perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database and handle common API interactions effectively

---

### **API Credentials**
Use the following credentials to authenticate your API requests:
- **TOKEN_ID:** `lZeEklqhQY9BBEU`
- **API_KEY:** `81451979866a85a2217844a541964137`

### **Features to Implement**
Your task is to build the following functionalities:
1. **Create Fruit Entry**
   - Add a new fruit to the inventory, including details such as name, quantity, and price.
   - **Bonus:** Validate entries so that if the fruit name already exists, it updates the existing fruit instead of creating a duplicate.

2. **View Inventory**
   - Fetch and display a list of all fruits in the database in a user-friendly format.

3. **Update Fruit Details**
   - Modify the quantity or price of an existing fruit in the inventory.

4. **Delete Fruit Entry**
   - Remove any fruit from the inventory with ease.

### **Error Handling**
Make sure to account for:
- Invalid input data (e.g., missing fields or incorrect data types).
- Authentication issues (e.g., failed token verification).
- Server-related errors, such as timeouts or connectivity issues.

---

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine you are a fruit vendor trying to streamline your inventory management:
- Add fruits like **Apple** or **Banana** with starting stock and price details.
- View the full inventory to monitor stock levels.
- Update fruit prices based on market trends.
- Remove fruits that are out of season or no longer sold.

---

### **Technical Requirements**
- Use **Python** with the `requests` module, or **PHP** with `cURL` or `Guzzle`, to interact with the API.
- Provide a simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** or a basic **web interface** (optional for PHP with HTML forms).
- Focus on implementing clean, modular code that reinforces API integration and error handling concepts.
